Abstract
Network based time series analysis has made considerable achievements in the recent
years. By mapping mono/multivariate time series into networks, one can investigate both
it’s microscopic and macroscopic behaviors. However, most proposed approaches lead to
the construction of static networks consequently providing limited information on evolution-
ary behaviors. In the present paper we propose a method called visibility graph based time
series analysis, in which series segments are mapped to visibility graphs as being descrip-
tions of the corresponding states and the successively occurring states are linked. This pro-
cedure converts a time series to a temporal network and at the same time a network of
networks. Findings from empirical records for stock markets in USA (S&P500 and Nasdaq)
and artificial series generated by means of fractional Gaussian motions show that the
method can provide us rich information benefiting short-term and long-term predictions.
Theoretically, we propose a method to investigate time series from the viewpoint of network
of networks.
Introduction
Complex network based time series analysis has attracted noteworthy attention in recent years
across various domains. By mapping a time series to a network, one can investigate visually the
structural patterns at different time scales from microscopic to macroscopic levels [ 1]. As a
result, several novel ways have been proposed on how to convert time series data into complex
networks. Zhang et al. [2–4] construct a network from pseudo periodic time series where each
cycle is represented by a single node, and a threshold is set to link node pairs with strong cross-
correlations. From the viewpoint of phase space reconstruction, one can also take all the possi-
ble series segments with a certain length as nodes. Xu et al propose an approach that links each
node with its closest k neighbors [5–8]. While in the references [ 9, 10] the nodes are networked
according to the correlation strength between the nodes, which turns out to be a special case of
the widely used recurrence network approach [ 11–24]. Lacasa et al propose the widely used vis-
ibility graph algorithms [25–35] by linking visible elements in a series. Each of these
approaches was quickly adopted and widely used among various researchers to extract infor-
mation embedded in time series from varied domains.

However, in the cited methods, a time series is projected to a static network. As a result, one
can hardly find the evolutionary behaviors of the system. A complicated system contains gener-
ally many elements, monitoring which produces a multivariate time series. In literature, several
novel methods are designed to extract from segments of the multivariate time series relation-
ship networks between the elements, as being the state representatives of the corresponding
time intervals. To cite examples, Munnix et al. [ 36] use the correlation matrix between stocks
to represent state of a stock market; In reference [ 37] Zheng, et al. employ the principal compo-
nent analysis to extract further believable information from the cross-correlation matrix; Gao
et al. [16, 17, 20, 21] embed a multivariate time series in a multi-dimensional phase space, and
calculate correlation between each pair of the phase tensors. Each segment of series corre-
sponding to each variate is mapped to a node. Strong relationships are reserved by introducing
different thresholds to filter out links between segments coming from the same series and from
different series, respectively. By this way, the recurrence network approach is extended to
investigate multivariate series; Buccheri et al. [ 38] construct from the correlation matrix the
plenary maximally filtered graphs (an extension of the simple spanning-tree), in which the
largest weights are retained while constraining the subgraph to be globally a planar graph;
While Gao [39, 40] conduct linear regressions of every element to other elements and the set of
values of fitting parameters are used to measure local states. The successive occurring states are
then linked into a transmission network.
The motivation of the present work is twofold. First, we try to find evolutionary behaviors
of a system embedded in one-dimensional time series. The existing algorithms to map a time
series to a network are generally designed in the framework of phase space reconstruction. For
a deterministic dynamical system, one can determine the embedding dimension of the system
m. All the segments with length m in the original time series are depicted in the phase space, as
being the states visited in the dynamical process. Every pair of states is linked if they are close
enough, which results into a network (e.g., recurrence network). But in the downstream proce-
dures of constructing networks, detailed information stored in the states is used in a rough
way. For example, in the recurrence plots one calculate the Euclidean distance between each
pair of the segments to measure the relationship between the states, in which the state informa-
tion is all lost except the distance. This roughness in using the information embedded in the
states covers up some interesting dynamical behaviors and this leads the focus only to the
global characteristics. Consequently, the states are not properly distinguished hence one cannot
monitor the system’s evolutionary behavior.
Quite often in practice, people are interested in the short-term prediction of a state. For
instance, one maybe interested in the present state of a stock, and its probable state in the fol-
lowing week. He may be concerned about the intensity of increase or decrease with reference to
historical data, an investigation that may not be obviously attained from literature review. This
guides our second motivation in this work in lieu of providing as concise as possible informa-
tion from a series segment (state).
In order to address the above stated motivations, we endeavor to extract state patterns con-
cisely while preserving the internal characteristics, and explore the transfer relations between
the distinguishable states. Contributions of the present work thus include,
We propose a method to construct a transmission network from a one-dimensional time
series, in which the nodes are the local states and the links the transfers between states. Techni-
cally, from an initial time series, one can extract all the segments in the series with a predefined
window size. We map each segment to a visibility graph, which is used to represent the state of
the system at the corresponding time interval. The successively occurring visibility graphs are
linked in turn, which leads to a transfer network of distinguishable states. The weights of links

reflect the transfer behaviors of the distinguishable states. This algorithm thus produces a ‘net-
work of visibility graphs’.
Some interesting findings are found from empirical data. To illustrate the functionality of
our algorithm, we investigate the Nasdaq and S&P500 daily stock indices. We find several
motifs, i.e., the states occurring with significant high frequencies compared with that in the
shuffled series. Similarly, there are several hub nodes, which occur with significantly high fre-
quencies compared with that of the other nodes. A transfer loop is also found between the
hubs, which can be used in short-term prediction, i.e, from the state at present time one pre-
dicts what will happen at the next time step. Some motifs are positioned in the time series
according to fractal behaviors, exhibiting long-term persistence of the time series. To validate
our approach, we also conduct detailed calculations for artificial time series generated with
fractional Gaussian motions, as being reference to understand the results for empirical data.
The fractional Gaussian motions exhibit similar characteristic behavior with that in recordings
of the stock markets.
In a nutshell, in the present work we propose a approach to convert a time series to a tempo-
ral network as well as a network of visibility graphs. By this way, the theories and tools in the
two speedy developing branches of complex network (network of networks [ 41] and temporal
networks [42]) can be extended to the field of time series analysis.
Method and Materials
Represent local States with visibility graphs
Let a window with size s slide along a time series, { y1, y2, ... , yN}. The covered segments read as
follows;
Yk ¼ð yk; ykþ1; /C1/C1/C1 ; ykþs/C0 1Þ;
k ¼ 1; 2; /C1/C1/C1 ; N /C0 s þ 1:
ð1Þ
We propose the visibility graph as the tool to extract structural information embedded in the
segments. The resulting visibility graphs can capture the key structural characteristics of the
corresponding segments, and consequently are taken as the description of the local sates in dif-
ferent time durations.
Now we map the segment Y
k to a visibility graph [25]. Each data value is considered to be a
node. Two nodes are connected if they can see each other, namely, a straight visibility line
exists between them. Formally, two arbitrary data values y
a and yb are visible to each other if
each point yc between them satisfies the criterion;
yc /C20 yb þð ya /C0 ybÞ: b /C0 c
b /C0 a : ð2Þ
The constructed visibility graph can be represented with an adjacency matrix, gk, whose ele-
ment gk(a − k +1 , b − k + 1) equals 1(0) if ya and yb are visible (invisible). Here, the identi ﬁca-
tion numbers of the nodes corresponding to ya and yb are assigned to be a − k + 1 and b − k
+ 1, to be sure they are in the interval of [1, s]. This results into an s by s matrix for the kth seg-
ment. Covering the whole series, a set of adjacency matrices, G ={ g1, g2, ... , gN−s+1} is obtained.
State transfer network
Here, we define a state transfer network to describe transfer probabilities between distinguish-
able local states. In the time series, if a state at time b occurs immediately after another state at
time a, then we construct a directional link from ga to gb. Accordingly, the link means a transfer

Abstract—The dynamics of a complex system is usually 
recorded in the form of time series. In recent years, the 
visibility graph algorithm and the horizontal visibility graph 
algorithm have been recently introduced as the mapping 
between time series and complex networks. Transforming time 
series into the graphs, the algorithms allows applying the 
methods of graph theoretical tools for characterizing time 
series, opening the possibility of building fruitful connections 
between time series analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and graph 
theory. This paper analyzes mainly the topological properties 
of visibility graphs and horizontal visibility graphs associated 
to random series and fractional Brownian motions series, with 
a special emphasis on degree distribution of the associated 
graphs. As an example, this paper study the visibility graph 
and horizontal visibility graph constructed from the total daily 
turnover of stock market, and unveil that the degree 
distribution of visibility graph has power-law tails, and the 
degree distribution of horizontal visibility graph has 
exponential tail. 
Keywords-Time series analysis; Visibility graph; Horizontal 
Visibility Graph; Degree distribution; Daily turnover of stock. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Random graph theory is considered as basis of research 
on the topological structure of complex networks, however, 
most of real complex networks are not random graph. The 
structure of complex networks is irregularly, complex and 
always changing with time, thus when the research objects 
are changed from simple and small networks to complex 
networks with thousands of vertices and edges, researchers 
begin to focus on the integrally dynamical property in 
complex networks. In 1998, Watts and Strogatz [1] proposed 
the famous model of small world networks. In 1999, 
Barabási and Albert [2] build evolutionary model of scale 
free networks. These two great works bring the research of 
complex networks into a new age. Since the end of 20 th 
century, the researches and applications of complex 
networks have already spread to many fields, such as 
mathematics, biology, information sciences.  The 
understanding on the features of complex networks in 
quantities and qualities has become a hot and challenging 
issue at present [3-5]. 
In the research of complex networks, one of the most 
critical aims is designing an intuitional, simple and effective 
method to build the model of complex networks for certain 
research objects.  Since 2000, utilizing the analysis of 
topological structure to understand the dynamical behavior 
of time series via mapping them to complex networks has 
attracted researcher’s great attention [6-10]. Zhang and Small 
[11,12] proposed an approach that map a time series to a 
cycle network. In this method, each vertex in network is a 
fragment in the time series. Edges between different vertices 
are determined by the similarity values or space distance of 
fragments. In 2008, Lacasa et al. [20] proposed the model of 
Visibility Graph (VG). In visibility graph, each vertex is 
each value in time series, edges between different vertices 
would exist if the two values can be “seen” with each other. 
The visibility graph is suitable for all kind of time series and 
the networks retain the structure information of time series. 
Particularly, periodic sequence is mapped to regular graph, 
random sequence is mapped to random graph and fractal 
sequence is mapped to scale free network. Meanwhile, in 
lacasa’s work there is a linear relationship between the 
degree distribution exponent of visibility graph vertices and 
Hurst exponent of fractional Brownian motion which 
generate the visibility graph [21]. For some stochastic 
process, the fractal property has tight relationship [22-23]. 
The visibility graph theory has been applied in many fields, 
such as the analysis of Chinese macro economy time series 
in seasons [24], the test of wide speed in central Argentina 
[25] and the dynamics of human’s heart  ect [26]. Although 
the visibility graph theory is based on the single variable 
time series and in this sense the research on the degree 
distribution cannot provide us more information, however, it 
is still useful for numerical analysis of time series. 
 As the research on visibility graph going deeper and 
deeper, Luque et al. [27] proposed Horizontal Visibility 
Graph (HVG) model. HVG is an improvement of VG, for 
the same time series, its HVG is the subgraph of its VG. 
Although the degree distributions of HVGs generated from 
chaos time series and correlated time series are all 
exponential distribution. However, the distribution values are 
different. When the value is less than ln(1.5), the HVG 
describe the chaos series, while when the value is larger than 
ln(1.5), the HVG describe the correlated random series, 
specially, when the distribution exponent is equal to ln(1.5), 
the HVG describe random series with independent 
identically distributed variable.  All the topological 
properties of HVG generated from fractional Brownian 
motion are depended on Hurst exponent: As the increasing of 
Hurst exponent, the absolute value of the degree distribution 
exponent of HVG is increasing, meanwhile, the clustering

coefficient is decreasing; the average length of path is 
increasing exponentially.  
VG and HVG algorithms are efficient tools to construct 
complex networks and they are bridges between complex 
networks theory and analysis of time series. In this paper we 
applied the two algorithms on financial time series data and 
make a comparison on the degree distribution of VG and 
HVG which are generated from the same series data.  
II. METHOD 
A. Visibility Graph 
 
In 2008, Lacasa et. al. proposed a method to construct 
visibility graph. In VG, the networks inherit some properties 
of time series. It is a brand new view on analysis of time 
series, and VG is a bridge between time series and complex 
networks and enriches the qualified analysis method form 
time series.  
In general, the VG generate from a time series obey the 
following “rules of visibility”: For any two value in time 
series ( ta, ya) and ( tb, yb) who will have visibility, and 
consequently will become two connected nodes of the 
associated graph, if any other data ( tc, yc) placed between 
them fulfills: 
() bc
cb a b
ba
ttyy yy tt
−<+ − −

The VG algorithm  map a time series 1, ,{}ii Nx = /g33to a 
complex network which can express by a adjacent matrix 
() ij N NAa ×=  if xi and xj in time series are satisfied the rule 
above,   aij=1, otherwise aij=0. In Fig.1 the part above is a bar 
plot of values of a periodical time series and the part below is 
its VG. In this VG, every node corresponds, in the same 
order of the original time series and two nodes are connected 
if visibility existed between the two values in time series 
which means if there is a straight line that connects the value, 
and it is not intersect any intermediate data value 
 

Figure 1. Illustration on VG Algorithm 
 
Thus, following the algorithm above, a VG that is generated 
from a time series have the properties below: 
 
(1) Connected: the VG is a full connected graph because 
there is one link  between each node and its nearest 
neighbors 
(2) Undirected: there is no direction defined in the links 
thus the VG is a undirected graph. 
(3)  Invariant: The VG structure is invariant under affine 
transformations of the series data. 
 
The VG that is generated from factional Brownian motion is 
not only a scale free network, but also a small world network. 
Its degree distribution follows the power law:  () ~P kk γ− 
If the series has a peak value ()HB th=  at time t, then the 
probability of the peak value has degree k can be denoted as: 
() ~ ()()frP kP k r k                 (2)
where ()frP k is the probability that series has the same peak 
value after k times step; r(k) is the percentage between 
number of the vertices that time t can see and the total 
number of vertices in VG from time t to time t + k in k times 
step. From factional Brownian motion series,  
2() ~ H
frP kk − and 1() ~ Hrk k − , then formula (2) can be write 
as 
21 2 3() ~ HH HPk k k k −− − = (3)
Then, there is a linear relationship between the exponent of 
the degree distribution in VG and the Hurst exponent of the 
accordingly fractional Brownian motion series.  
()32H Hγ =− (4)
The tail of the degree distribution of VG generated from 
random time series follows a power law: () ~ kP ke λ− . At the 
beginning of the curve, the distribution is like Poisson 
distribution while the tail obeys exponential distribution.  
Actually, let kt denote as the connection between value t and 
other vertices, if the value of kt was large, then kt+1 would be 
very small, that’s because the time series is random. Thus at 
the tail of degree distribution, it become to obey exponential 
distribution.  
B. Horizontal Visibility Graph 
As the research on the algorithm for VG construction 
going deeper, an algorithm for horizontal visibility graph 
construction is proposed by Luque et al. in 2009 which is a 
simpler and more effective method. HVG is much simpler 
and more precise on analysis of the topological properties of 
networks. Meanwhile, HVG can describe the statistical 
properties of random series more effectively.  
Let {xi},i=1,…, N be a time series o f N data. The HVG 
algorithm assigns each value of the series to a node. The two 
nodes i and j in the graph are connected if one can draw a 
horizontal line in the time series joining xi and xj that does 
not intersect any intermediated data height. Thus, the two 
connected nodes i and j should satisfied with the following 
rule: 
,, |ij nx xxn i n j>∀< <  (5) 
Accordingly, { xi},i=1,…, N is transformed into HVG G, 
and () ×= ij N NAa is the adjacency matrix of G, where aij =1 if 
the value xi and xj can be connected according the horizontal 
visible rule above, and aij =0 if not. 
 
The HVG algorithm is an improvement and simplification 
of the VG algorithm. Actually, the HVG is always a 
subgraph of the VG which are generated from the same time

series. Accordingly, the HVG associated with a time series 
always has the following features: 
(1) Connected: the HVG is a full connected graph because 
there is one link  between each node and its nearest 
neighbors; 
(2) Invariant: The VG structure is invariant under affine 
transformations of the series data. 
(3) Undirected and directed characters of the mapping: the 
algorithm generates undirected graphs, however we 
could also get a directed graph in such a way that for a 
given node which have the ingoing degree and outgoing 
degree; 
(4) Reversible and irreversible characters of the mapping: 
some information of the time series is inevitably lost 
when the network is constructed. For example, the two 
periodic series with the same period as T1=…,2,3,2,3,… 
and T2=…,4,5,4,5,…would have the same visibility 
graph and the same adjacency matrix. However T1 and 
T2 still could be distinguished from each other 
quantitatively via constructing weighted HVGs.  
 
 
Figure 2. Illustration on HVG Algorithm. 
 
As the increasing of the Hurst exponent H, the absolute 
value of the slope λ of HVG generated from the fractional 
brown motion series increases and the clustering coefficient 
decreases, the average path distance L increase exponentially. 
The HVG generated from any random series is a small world 
networks. And its degree distribution obeys the unified 
exponential form:  
 212() () ( )33
kPk −= (6)
which means the degree distribution have no relationship 
with probability density function.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section we construct VG based on the turnovers per 
day time series of the Chinese stock market since 2012 to 
2014 and describe their degree distribution curve in figure 3, 
figure 4. For the same data, we also construct HVG by 
matlab and give the semi-log plot and log-log plot of its 
degree distribution in figure 5 and figure 6. For both of the 
two degree distribution semi-log plot and log- log plot, the 
linear least square fitting method is used to obtain the slope .

Figure 5. Degree Distribution of HVG 
 
In figure 3, the degree distribution of VG is center on 
() 0Pk = around. The nodes with degree probability between 
0.05 and 0.2 are too few which leads most of the nodes in the 
figure are located in the left bottom. Thus the local degree 
distribution cannot describe the statistical of the series. 
However in figure 4, the degree distribution of HVG is more 
uniform, the points in the figure are proximal in one straight 
line. log( ( )) 0.19217 0.15099Pk k =− +

, thus the degree 
distribution of VG of the stock turnover time series obey the 
power low and its probability distribution function is 
satisfied with (6). 
In figure 5, there are seldom available points and in the tail 
of the fitting straight line of the degree distribution, the 
points are not located uniformly, thus it is not clear that 
whether the degree distribution tail of the HVG follows the 
power law. In figure 6, there are more available points and 
they are uniformly located around the fitting straight line. 
Thus the degree distribution of HVG generated from the 
stock turnover since 2012 obey the power law () ~ −P kk γ and 
the HVG is a scale free network. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The algorithms of VG and HVG are applied for the 
analysis of time series. The statistical properties can be 
obtained from the topological properties of the networks. In 
this paper we applied the two algorithms on the analysis of 
Chinese stock turnover time series since 2012. The degree 
distribution of VG followed the power law () ~ −P kk γ , its 
VG is a scale free network, while the degree distribution of  
HVG of the time series data is satisfied with the exponential 
distribution, the probability distribution function is 
approximately equal to 2() ( 1 / 3 ) ( 2 / 3 )kPk −= 
